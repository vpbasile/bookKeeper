# New Feature: Platform Tracking

I want to add the ability to track which platforms I have purchased a given book on (e.g., Kindle, Audible, Paperback, etc.). This will help me avoid duplicate purchases and better manage my reading resources.

To implement this feature, I will need to:
- Update the data model to include a list of platforms for each book
- Modify the UI to allow users to select and view the platforms associated with each book
- Create functions to add or remove platforms from a book's record
- Create a function that updates the books file with the new platform information whenever a book is added or modified


Group by series

Maybe separate read and unread into separate json files
